            <h2>History of AI</h2>
            <p>history of artificial intelligence (AI), a survey of important events and people in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) from the early work of British logician Alan Turing in the 1930s to advancements at the turn of the 21st century. AI is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. For modern developments in AI, see artificial intelligence.</p>

            <h2>How AI Will Impact the Future</h2>
            <h3>Improved Business Automation</h3>
            <p>About 55 percent of organizations have adopted AI to varying degrees, suggesting increased automation for many businesses in the near future. With the rise of chatbots and digital assistants, companies can rely on AI to handle simple conversations with customers and answer basic queries from employees.</p>
            <p>AI's ability to analyze massive amounts of data and convert its findings into convenient visual formats can also accelerate the decision-making process. Company leaders don't have to spend time parsing through the data themselves, instead using instant insights to make informed decisions.</p>
            <p>“If [developers] understand what the technology is capable of and they understand the domain very well, they start to make connections and say, 'Maybe this is an AI problem, maybe that's an AI problem,’” said Mike Mendelson, a learner experience designer for NVIDIA. “That's more often the case than, 'I have a specific problem I want to solve.'”</p>
        
            <h3>Data Privacy Issues</h3>
            <p>Companies require large volumes of data to train the models that power generative AI tools, and this process has come under intense scrutiny. Concerns over companies collecting consumers' personal data have led the FTC to open an investigation into whether OpenAI has negatively impacted consumers through its data collection methods after the company potentially violated European data protection laws.</p>
            <p>In response, the Biden-Harris administration developed an AI Bill of Rights that lists data privacy as one of its core principles. Although this legislation doesn't carry much legal weight, it reflects the growing push to prioritize data privacy and compel AI companies to be more transparent and cautious about how they compile training data.</p>
        
            <h3>Increased Regulation</h3>
            <p>AI could shift the perspective on certain legal questions, depending on how generative AI lawsuits unfold in 2024. For example, the issue of intellectual property has come to the forefront in light of copyright lawsuits filed against OpenAI by writers, musicians, and companies like The New York Times. These lawsuits affect how the U.S. legal system interprets what is private and public property, and a loss could spell major setbacks for OpenAI and its competitors.</p>
            <p>Ethical issues that have surfaced in connection to generative AI have placed more pressure on the U.S. government to take a stronger stance. The Biden-Harris administration has maintained its moderate position with its latest executive order, creating rough guidelines around data privacy, civil liberties, responsible AI, and other aspects of AI. However, the government could lean toward stricter regulations, depending on changes in the political climate.</p>
        
            <h3>Climate Change Concerns</h3>
            <p>On a far grander scale, AI is poised to have a major effect on sustainability, climate change, and environmental issues. Optimists can view AI as a way to make supply chains more efficient, carrying out predictive maintenance and other procedures to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
            <p>At the same time, AI could be seen as a key culprit in climate change. The energy and resources required to create and maintain AI models could raise carbon emissions by as much as 80 percent, dealing a devastating blow to any sustainability efforts within tech. Even if AI is applied to climate-conscious technology, the costs of building and training models could leave society in a worse environmental situation than before.</p>
